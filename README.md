# Beerguru

The front end work contains project, which uses <a href="https://punkapi.com/" target="_blank">**PunkApi**</a> and shows you all beers from API. This work was done using the React library.

## Functionality
In this project, I decided to complete all functionality with Hooks, without Redux.

After the page will be loaded, a user can choose a beer. As a result he will receive a beer description and three propositions with similar values. The application has loaders and a user will be notified about data loading.

**The project is deployed on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">**Heroku**</a> and it can be in sleep mode, you should wait a while the server is started**
